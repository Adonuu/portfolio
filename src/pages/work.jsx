      <h3>Product Validation Engineer (2019-2021)</h3>
      <p>
        I began my career at Milacron right after university in the product validation department, where I developed a deep understanding of the mechanical, electrical, and software systems of our machines.
        My role involved tuning machines to meet engineering specifications and documenting test procedures for new products.
        I worked extensively with PID (proportional-integral-derivative) control loops for servo motor controllers and hydraulic proportional valves.
        To optimize these systems, I delved into control theory and software applications, sparking my interest in improving machine performance through software.
        Additionally, I explored ways to enhance the human-machine interface (HMI) to improve user experience, ultimately leading me to transition into the software development group.
      </p>
      <h3>Controls Software Engineer (2021-2023)</h3>
      <p>
        In this role, I developed features for both existing and in-development control systems, implementing customer-requested machine sequencing and porting control features to a new platform.
        I gained a comprehensive understanding of the machine software architecture, including the custom libraries used for machine control.
        Leveraging this knowledge, I led a project to enhance injection process performance in hydraulic machines, reducing load sensitivity from 3% to less than 1%, making it comparable to all-electric counterparts.
        This work led me to join the Control Systems Architecture department.
      </p>
      <h3>Control Systems Architecture Engineer (2023-Present)</h3>
      <p>
        In my current role, I am focused on developing the next-generation controls platform, particularly the new human-machine interface (HMI).
        This platform utilizes .NET Core and Blazor for the interface, with OPC-UA facilitating communication with the PLC.
        I developed the core backend for managing OPC-UA client interactions, enabling efficient PLC read/write operations and data logging to an SQLite database.
        Additionally, I have implemented user experience enhancements such as drag-and-drop functionality.
        This role allows me to apply my passion for software engineering to drive product improvements.

        The Odin Project
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am currently working through The Odin Project&apos;s full-stack development course using Node.js.
        Through this, I have gained a deeper understanding of web technologies, including React, Express, and Node.js,
        which has contributed to improvements in our .NET/Blazor codebase.
