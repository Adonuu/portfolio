        as a Controls System Architecture Engineer.  
        I&apos;m actively learning web development, as well as deepening my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

      <p>
        My fascination with computer software began in childhood, driven by a passion for reverse engineering. I loved taking things apart to understand how they worked from the inside out, 
        which ultimately shaped my career path.
      </p>
      <p>
        This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Mechanical Engineering, after which I started my career as a test engineer.  
        Over time, I became increasingly interested in the software behind machine control systems, which inspired my transition into controls engineering.  
        Writing software to control machines gave me a new perspective, fueling my desire to explore traditional software development.  
        Now, I&apos;m expanding my skills in software engineering to bridge the gap between controls and modern application development.
